# note-taker

An application that allows the user to write new 'notes' and keep them saved until they decided to delete them. This app utilizes server routes to post/store/retrieve the user input. 

## Motivation

There is no question of the convenience of having an app that gives you the ability to take, track, and keep notes on your personal device. Whether it is a grocery store list, things you need to get done at work, a cool quote you heard and don't want to forget, or a couple of ideas you happen to have while out and about, a note taking app will aid you in all of your ventures and ensure all of that stuff rambling around in your head has a tangible place to be stored at your convenience.
